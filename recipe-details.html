      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          To make this popular Afghan dish, first crush <br />the onion and fry
          with some oil until golden. <br />Then add the turmeric and saute.
          <br />Remove half of the hot onion and set aside.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Add the meat to the hot onion and saute <br />
          until the color is darkened and the meat is accumulated. <br />
          Now add some boiling water and cook over <br />
          high heat. Then reduce the heat, <br />
          close the container door and allow <br />
          the meat for an hour to cook. <br />
          One quarter to half an hour before <br />
          the meat is fully baked, <br />
          add salt and allow the water to be very <br />
          low or completely.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          place them in cold water for 1 to 2 minutes to soften. <br />
          Wash pistachios and almonds and skip the filter. <br />
          Pour half of the hot onion that <br />
          you have separated into the pan and place over <br />
          medium heat, then add the carrots and saute <br />
          for five minutes.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Make rice in a rinse. <br />
          Put the washed rice with water, <br />
          salt and oil on the gas heat and drain for 10 minutes. <br />
          Now it's time to caramel to make the <br />sugar of the plate. To
          caramel, pour <br />
          it into a suitable container and place on very low heat without water.
          Let the sugar start to melt.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Remove the sugar from heat. <br />
          This process is long and may take up to 5 minutes. Pour the pot a
          little oil. <br />
          Pour the pot of rice. Then pour some of <br />
          the meat over the rice and pour from the carrot mixture <br />
          over the meat.

      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>8 ounces (225 g) Greek feta</li>
        <li>4 ounces (115 g) Muenster or Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>2 1/2 ounces (70 g) fresh goat cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped mixed tender herbs and tender stems</li>
        <li>4 scallions (2 ounces; 60 g), thinly sliced (1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs (110 g), lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a medium bowl, combine feta, Muenster, goat cheese, <br />herbs,
          scallions, eggs, and pepper, and toss <br />
          gently to combine. Cover and set aside.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Wrap spinach in a clean kitchen towel <br />
          or double layer of paper towels <br />
          and squeeze to remove excess moisture <br />
          (you should end up with about 6 ounces (170g) spinach) <br />
          Transfer to a medium bowl, along with feta,<br />
          goat cheese, herbs, scallions, eggs, <br />
          salt, and pepper, and toss gently <br />
          to combine. Cover and set aside.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Adjust oven rack to middle position <br />
          and preheat oven to 350°F (190°C). <br />
          Using a sharp knife, cut stack <br />of phyllo sheets in half to form
          <br />
          eighteen 13- by 9-inch sheets. <br />
          Stack together and cover with a sheet <br />
          of parchment and a clean kitchen towel.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium <br />
          heat and cook, swirling pan frequently <br />
          and taking care not to let butter solids <br />
          brown (lower heat as needed to medium-low <br />if butter begins to
          pop and brown), <br />
          until foaming subsides <br />
          (an indication that water has been driven off), <br />
          about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Remove one phyllo sheet from stack <br />and transfer to clean work
          surface, <br />
          with the long end of the sheet <br />
          running parallel to edge of counter. <br />
          Working lengthwise, brush half of phyllo <br />
          sheet that is closest to you <br />
          lightly but evenly with butter. <br />
          Fold sheet in half toward you <br />
          lengthwise, covering the buttered <br />portion of dough. Rotate sheet
          90 degrees <br />
          so short side now faces you, <br />
          and brush entire surface of sheet <br />
          lightly but evenly with butter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a 1/4 cup measure, place a scant <br />
          3 tablespoons (40g) filling on the bottom left-hand <br />corner of
          sheet, about one inch from the bottom <br />
          edge. Using a spoon, form filling <br />
          into a rough triangle with its long <br />
          edge (hypotenuse) facing the bottom right <br />
          edge of the phyllo. Lift the <br />
          bottom right corner of the phyllo <br />
          and fold it over the filling and <br />
          gently press to form a right triangle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake until golden and crisp, <br />
          20 to 23 minutes, rotating baking sheet <br />
          halfway through baking. Transfer baking <br />
          sheet to wire rack and let <br />
          boreks cool at least 5 minutes <br />
          before serving. Serve.

      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
        <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3/4 cups (490g) bread flour</li>
        <li>
          2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a
          wood-fired pizza oven)
        </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bring yeast, flour and sugar (or maple syrup) <br />
          to room temperature. I generally <br />
          keep all of these out of the fridge an <br />
          hour before making the dough.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Firstly pour half cup luke <br />
          warm water to a large mixing bowl. <br />
          Dip your finger in the water <br />
          to check if it is just warm & not hot. <br />
          Hot water will kill the <br />
          yeast and won’t let the pizza dough rise.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Add 1 teaspoon yeast (3 grams) <br />
          to the warm water. You can <br />use instant yeast or active yeast.
          <br />
          More details in the tips section below. <br />
          If you prefer to go with low <br />
          yeast and let it rise slowly, <br />then add only 1/3 teaspoon yeast
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Add 1 teaspoon raw sugar or maple syrup. <br />
          Avoid using refined white sugar.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The mixture must turn frothy and bubbly. <br />
          With instant yeast it won’t turn <br />
          very frothy but will still froth to a <br />
          minimum and you can see the yeast bubbling up.

          leek, and garlic; cook and stir <br />
          until onion is transparent. <br />
          Add ground beef; cook and stir until <br />

        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Season with cumin, cardamom, salt, <br />
          and pepper; mix well. Continue cooking until beef is browned and
          crumbly. <br />
          Remove the skillet from heat.

        <br />
        <li>
          Mix flour and water together in <br />

          Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan <br />
          to 365 degrees F (170 degrees C). <br />
          There should be enough oil to submerge <br />

          in hot oil until golden brown.

          inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins, <br />

          For the buttercream, put 100g chopped milk chocolate <br />
          in a heatproof bowl and melt <br />
          in the microwave, stirring every 30 secs. <br />
          Leave the melted chocolate to cool for 5 mins.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mash 200g softened butter and 400g <br />
          icing sugar together with <br />
          a fork, then switch to a wooden spoon <br />
          or electric beaters, if you have them.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Sift in 5 tbsp cocoa powder <br />
          with a pinch of salt and pour <br />

        <br />
        <li>
          On a cake stand or large plate, <br />
          sandwich the cakes together <br />
          with half of the buttercream, <br />
          then spread the rest on top. <br />
          Decorate with chocolate shards, if you like.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          To make chocolate shards: <br />
          melt 50g dark chocolate and pour <br />
          it onto a tray lined with <br />
          baking parchment or foil.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Now melt 25g milk chocolate and <br />25g white chocolate and drizzle
          them <br />
          over the dark chocolate before it sets.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Shake the tray gently to level the mixture <br />
          then leave to set somewhere cool. Chop into shards.
